# adf-leads

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fetch-auto/adf-leads.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fetch-auto/adf-leads)

### Purpose

To generate xml auto leads in the adf format http://adfxml.info/adf_spec.pdf from js objects.

### Current status

Currently this is very specific to the structure of leads we send at Fetch Auto and will populate only a small subset of ADF tags. It could be easily extended however.
